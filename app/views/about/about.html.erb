<%# Project overview %>
<p>This project utilizies the "Subjects", "Work & Edition", & "Authors" APIs from OpenLibrary's Index of APIS to create a navigable and searchable index of
horror, fantasy, romance, poetry, and thriller books.</p>
<%# Subjects API %>
<p>Subjects API - This API is used to fetch data from books that belong to a specific subject/genre.
It returns the "title", "first_publish_year", "edition_count", "cover_id", "author_key" and "work_key" of each book.</p>
<%# Work & Edition API %>
<p>Work & Edition API - This API is used to fetch the description of each book since it is not available in the "Subjects API" response.
It takes the "work_key" from the "Subjects API" response to make a JSON request to the "Work & Edition API" and returns the
description of each book.
</p>
<%# Authors API %>
<p>Authors API - This API is used to fetch data for the author of each book. It takes the "author_key" from the "Subjects API" response to make
  a JSON request to the "Authors API" and returns the "name" and "bio" of each author.
